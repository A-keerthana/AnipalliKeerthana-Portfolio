## Work Experience
**IOS Student Developer @ IOS Student Developement Centre, SRM University of Science and Technology(SRMIST) (_July 2024 - Present_)**
- Developing an IOS application that requires Machine Learning and Iphone tools to develop and deploy the features like virtual try on and body measurements. The
application is to make online shopping easy and no-return convienient by providing effective features. 
- Using swift programming, UI kit and playgrounds we are developing the UI/UX of the application and backend not stored anywhere but in application itself running using NVidia CPU and apple silicon. Tested in an iPhone the initial iteration of the virtual try-on feature on iPhone lidar sensor fortaking real-time input image.

**Research Intern @ Aeronautical Development and Establishment(ADE), (DRDO) (_Dec 2023 - Jan 2024_)**
- Performed image processing tasks on data and the project “Aerial Object Detection” done using MATLAB and Python programming. Yolo, ComputerVision tools and libraries were used while working on this project and data manipulation, enhancement of image frames were performed.
- Detected Target in UAV input vieos that were in NightVisiona nd Daylight modes. Helped in 10% quick image manipulation tasks. Gave presentations on the detectors used, model and code to EOP division. 

**Python Intern @ SRM University of Science and Technology, SRMIST (_Sep 2023 - Feb 2024)**
- Internship Program, SRM IST, Chennai and my supervisor was from the Department of Automobile Engineering.
- Structured internship by all scenario-based coding questions, practiced codes in Python programming using Kattis platform and various tasks for evaluation.

## Research Projects
### Project 1 : Multimodal Insider Threat Detection, National Intittute of Technology(NIT), Trichy

Using a neural network model, temporal dynamic transformer with attention mechanism as the data from Carnegie Mellon University dataset is time-ordered, unbalanced and supervised and is around 30-50MB large. Identifying employees behavioural patterns to prevent information being stolen. Pre-processed NLP data separately and numerical data separately using channels and classifiers and concatenated the classifiers. **Supervisors :** Prof. R. Mohan and Prof. Sivakumar.

### Project 2: Privacy Attack in Reinforcement Learning, Australian Nexus Tulip Project.

Using methodologies Imitation Learning(IL) and Knowledge Distillation(KD) are implemented in the widely used Gym mujoco and Atari environments. Analyzing the reward reconstruction attack, wherein seeking to reconstruct the original reward from a privacy-preserving policy using an Inverse RL algorithm. And inferring a gap between the current standard of privacy offered and the standard of privacy needed to protect reward functions in RL. **Supervisors :** Prof. Gang Li from Deakin University and Prof. Yike Li.
